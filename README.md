*USE*

    Install the ListFiles Plugin in an OctoberCMS website.
        There is nothing in Settings or the Backend navigation
        ListFiles exists solely as a component

    Create or open a CMS Page or Partial
    
    Add the ListFiles component to the page or partial
        Drag the component to the place on the page or partial where the list will be displayed

    Use the selector to choose which folder to display
        The default directory is 'media'
        Add to the path as necessary
        e.g., /board-meetings/2020/november
 
    Add as many components as necessary to the page
        one component per folder to display
 
    Optional: Fork the component to customize look and flow of the list
        FileList provides a simple list, but can be customized
